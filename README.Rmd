![shed](inst/img/shed.png)


A minimal, eye-friendly csv editor made with shiny, rhandsontable and readr. 
Shed is designed to quickly edit small (hundreds of rows) csv files and
`data.frames`. It uses `readr::write_excel_csv()` as backend for writing files, 
and thus produces UTF-8 encoded csv files that are compatbile with MS Excel
by default.


## Help Wanted

Shed is still in an early stage of development. If you think shed could be 
useful to you you can contribute in the following way:

* File feature requests and bug reports in the issue tracker
* Make a more modern looking, light css theme for shed (see 
  `inst/css/shed_dark.css`)


## Installation

You can install shed from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("s-fleck/shed")
```


## Example

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
shed(iris)

# Uppon termination, shed returns the edited data.frame

x <- shed(iris)
```
